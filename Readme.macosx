If compiling on Leopard, you may receive the error message

  undefined symbol: _strtod_ASL

The solution is to add the flag

  -mmacosx-version-min=10.4

to the compiler options.

Depending on your local architecture, you may also need to add one or more
`-arch` flags to `CXX_FLAGS`. For instance, `-arch x86_64` to build a pure 64
bit library, or `-arch i386 -arch x86_64` to build both the 32 and 64 bit
versions.
