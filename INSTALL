Installing LibAmpl

Requirements: - The bash shell,
              - A C compiler,
              - Autoconf+Automake+Libtool


I. Installation:

 # sh autogen.sh
 # ./configure
 # make 
 # make install

II. Testing:

 A simple way to test your installation of libampl is to try out the `miniampl` 
 driver. You can download it using:

     git clone git://github.com/dpo/miniampl.git

III. Contributions, bug fixes, suggestions

 Github !

IV. Troubleshooting

If compiling on Leopard, you may receive the error message

  undefined symbol: _strtod_ASL

The solution is to add the flag

  -mmacosx-version-min=10.4

to the compiler options.

Depending on your local architecture, you may also need to add one or more
`-arch` flags to `CXX_FLAGS`. For instance, `-arch x86_64` to build a pure 64
bit library, or `-arch i386 -arch x86_64` to build both the 32 and 64 bit
versions.
